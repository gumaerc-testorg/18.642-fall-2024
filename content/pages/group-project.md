---
**Note**: Every group member submitting a different 5–7 page draft focusing on their particular section.

Prepare an introductory, written lecture note on the topic with the target audience being fellow students with no prior knowledge of the topic.

### Draft 1 Assignment

Your objectives in this assignment are to demonstrate active individual work on the group project and to solicit feedback on your progress thus far. Depending on your topic, your draft may include 3-4 polished pages of content plus 1-2 pages of introduction/motivation, or it might include 5-7 pages of notes discussing/developing mathematical content. It can be anywhere in between these two descriptors, or you can aim for a more complete draft than 3-4 pages. While you may be working in a group, submissions for this assignment should be by individual, focusing on your contribution/section-responsibilities in the final paper. The final section of your submission should be a reflection section in which you identify what feedback you would like to receive. That is, what questions do you have for how to proceed with the project presentation and lecture note.

### Assessment

Your grade on this draft will be based on evidence of individual focused, productive effort on the group project (as evidenced by 5+ pages of draft text and/or content).

### Project Timeline

In the week after, you will be asked to peer review another group’s draft notes and continue revising the note and preparing the oral presentation. Oral presentations ( 15-20 minutes) of lecture notes will be scheduled in class subsequently.
