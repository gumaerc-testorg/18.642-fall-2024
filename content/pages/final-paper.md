### Final Paper Proposal

The final paper proposal should include:                
        \* Final Paper Topic or Tentative Paper Title                
        \* Objective of the paper                
        \* List of resources you plan to use (e.g., specific articles, web sites, as appropriate).

Every student will write their own final paper. It is fine to propose a continuation or extension of the group project topic but each paper (or specific sections of a group project paper) will be an individual effort.

Final papers are due the last day of lectures. The paper grade will be based in part on math content, quality of writing, and logical flow/organization. It can be a group project but with clearly named individual sections. The grade is individual! Papers will have typical lengths of 10-15 pages.

### Final Paper Draft 1 Notes

#### Description:

Your objectives in this assignment are to demonstrate active work on the final paper and to solicit feedback on your progress thus far. Depending on your our topic, your draft may include 3-4 polished pages of content plus 1-2 pages of introduction/motivation, or it might include 5-7 pages of notes discussing/developing mathematical content. It can be anywhere in between these two descriptors, or you can aim for a more complete draft than 3-4 pages.

The final section of your submission should be a reflection section in which you identify what feedback you would like to receive. That is, what questions do you have for how to proceed with the research and writing.

#### Assessment

Your grade on this draft will be based on evidence of focused, productive report in the research and writing of your paper (as evidenced by 5+ pages of draft text and/or content)

This assignment will include peer reviews in the following week.
